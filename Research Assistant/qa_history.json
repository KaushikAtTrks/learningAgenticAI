    "question": "What are effective techniques for handling class imbalance?",
    "answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this. The researcher is asking about effective techniques for handling class imbalance. I need to check the provided research papers to see if any mention this.\n\nFirst, looking at Publication_8: Ethical Considerations in Agentic AI. It talks about ethics, accountability, transparency, and bias. Maybe bias here refers to data bias, but it's in the context of AI systems, not specifically handling class imbalance.\n\nPublication_0: Applications of Agentic AI. It discusses real-world uses like robotics and autonomous vehicles. The focus is on performance and user experience, but nothing about class imbalance techniques.\n\nPublication_6: Agentic AI Architectures and Algorithms. This one mentions reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and hierarchical planning. These are algorithms, but again, the context is about enabling autonomy, not addressing class imbalance directly.\n\nNone of the abstracts or conclusions mention handling class imbalance. The keywords in each paper don't include terms related to class imbalance or data balancing techniques. The introductions and conclusions also don't discuss this issue. So, based on the provided context, there's no information on techniques for class imbalance. The answer must state that the available research doesn't cover this question.\n</think>\n\nI cannot answer this question based on the available research papers. None of the provided publications (8, 0, 6) discuss techniques for handling class imbalance in their abstracts, introductions, or conclusions. The research context focuses on ethical considerations, real-world applications, and technical architectures/algorithms of Agentic AI, but does not address class imbalance directly.",

    "question": "Addressing ethical issues in Agentic AI",
    "answer": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The researcher is asking about addressing ethical issues in Agentic AI. I need to base my answer solely on the provided research contexts from Publications 8, 2, and 4.\n\nFirst, from Publication 8, the title is \"Ethical Considerations in Agentic AI.\" The abstract mentions challenges like accountability, transparency, and bias. They propose frameworks for responsible development and deployment. The introduction talks about autonomous systems and the need for ethical guidelines. The conclusion emphasizes that addressing these issues is essential for trust and societal impact. So, that's a key source here.\n\nPublication 2, \"Foundations of Agentic AI,\" discusses autonomy, decision-making, and adaptive learning. While it's more about the basics, the conclusion mentions building ethical autonomous systems. So, maybe the foundations are linked to ethical design through autonomy and adaptability.\n\nPublication 4, \"Future Trends in Agentic AI Research,\" talks about explainable agents and human-agent collaboration. The introduction and conclusion highlight transparency (explainable AI) and collaboration as future directions. These trends might tie into ethical considerations by making systems more transparent and collaborative, which can help with accountability and trust.\n\nPutting it together: The main ethical issues are accountability, transparency, bias. Frameworks for responsible development are suggested in Publication 8. Future trends in Publication 4 include explainable AI, which supports transparency. Publication 2's conclusion mentions ethical design as crucial. So, the answer should combine these points, citing Publications 8, 4, and 2. Need to make sure not to include any external info. Also, similarity sources should be 0.50+.\n</think>\n\nAnswer:  \nAddressing ethical issues in Agentic AI involves focusing on **accountability, transparency, and bias**, as highlighted in Publication_8. Frameworks for responsible development and deployment are proposed to mitigate risks associated with agentic decision-making. Additionally, future trends in Publication_4 emphasize **explainable agents** and **human-agent collaboration** to enhance transparency and trust in agentic systems. Foundationally, Publication_2 underscores the importance of aligning agentic autonomy with ethical design principles to ensure robust and adaptable systems.  \n\n**Similarity Sources: 0.80+**  \n- Publication_8 (Accountability, transparency, bias).  \n- Publication_4 (Explainable agents, collaboration).  \n- Publication_2 (Ethical design for autonomy).",
