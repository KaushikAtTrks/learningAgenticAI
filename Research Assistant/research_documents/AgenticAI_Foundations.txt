Title: Foundations of Agentic AI

Abstract:
This paper explores the foundational principles of Agentic AI, focusing on autonomous decision-making, goal-driven behavior, and adaptive learning. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings and the evolution of agentic systems in artificial intelligence.

Keywords: Agentic AI, autonomy, decision-making, adaptive learning

Introduction:
Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of independent action, pursuing goals, and adapting to changing environments. This paper reviews the core concepts and historical development of agentic models.

Conclusion:
Understanding the foundations of Agentic AI is crucial for building robust, flexible, and ethical autonomous systems.
